MediaTek MT7601 USB WIFI on the Raspberry Pi
I bought an USB WIFI dongle, on ebay, to use with the Raspberry Pi. I thought the chip was a Ralink chip which is supported, but it turned out it was a MediaTek MT7601.

Bus 001 Device 005: ID 148f:7601 Ralink Technology, Corp.
All this is for Raspian and I have gathered all the steps needed here.

Driver
The driver is available at their web side download page here. Find the one called "MT7601U USB". I have the file mirrored here.

These instructions work for building the driver.

Become root.

sudo -s
Download latest updates.

apt-get update
apt-get upgrade
rpi-update
Download linux kernel source, this is needed to compile the driver module.

cd /usr/src

#git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux.git
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux
sudo ln -s /usr/src/linux /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build
cd linux
Prepare the kernel with the current kernel config from the running system.

make mrproper
zcat /proc/config.gz > .config
cp .config .config.org
make modules_prepare
Download the module symbols of the current kernel, to avoid having to recompile the kernel.

wget https://raw.github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/master/extra/Module.symvers
Get the MT7601 USB driver into your home directory. Then, lets uncompress the file.

cd ~ 
tar -xvjpf DPO_MT7601U_LinuxSTA_3.0.0.4_20130913.tar.bz2 
cd DPO*
The default driver is really noisy and spits out a lot of debug information. This behaviour can be stopped by changing a line in os/linux/rt_linux.c from:

ULONG RTDebugLevel = RT_DEBUG_TRACE;
to:

ULONG RTDebugLevel = 0; // RT_DEBUG_TRACE;
Finally build the driver and install it.
cd src
make
make install

#Then use the Wi-Fi rename of ra0 on wlan0 and that the file:
sudo cat > /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules <<EOF
ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="net", ATTR{type}=="1", KERNEL=="ra*", NAME = "wlan0"
EOF

Raspbian configuration
Configure the ra0 interface for DHCP and make it start at boot. Edit /etc/network/interfaces to look like:

auto lo

iface lo inet loopback
iface eth0 inet dhcp

auto ra0
allow-hotplug ra0
iface ra0 inet dhcp
wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
iface default inet dhcp
Then add your WIFI name and key to /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf.

ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1

network={
        ssid="YOURWIFINAME"
        key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
        psk="YOURPASSWORD"
}
The wireless network is then brought up by:

ifup ra0
or a reboot.
